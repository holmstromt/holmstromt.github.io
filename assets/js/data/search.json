Did you deliver me this reminder on your own wings?I’d give it all to hear you just once more… but no. Your echo reached me for a reason, one I can hear.My window is open just enough for your favorite plant To gesture with its leaves to a gleam on the outside.Into the night I go, barefoot and shivering with no cares Except whatever you are guiding me towards… ah.The playground where I first swallowed sand for you, Still too young and foolish to know how to make friends.You light up this spot, the same spot I hid it: The symbol of everything you mean to me.In the night your star is just enough for me to see A symbol that might have come from anybody…But I’m enough of a fool to see this star in the sand And remember all the times we watched them dance.And so… for you, I shall let sleep take me away, Knowing that when I awake, the wind will still blow." }, { "title": "To The Weary Artists", "url": "/posts/To-The-Weary-Artists/", "categories": "Letter", "tags": "letter", "date": "2022-01-27 17:30:00 -0700", "snippet": "Dear Artists,Dear you frustrated that you have more paint on your apron than the canvas, you with words in your brain that just can’t seem to find a way out of your skull, you who can’t find your pencil buried somewhere in the mountains of balled up papers, you fighting the urge to wad up some clay and toss it like a fastball at your incomprehensible sculpture, you wondering why none of the fifty pictures you took of a sunflower field feel worthy of being seen… before you ask the question, allow me to tell you what the point is.Who am I, you ask? I am every canvas that has ever been decorated, each scrap of paper and computer document used to weave literary yarn, any inanimate person given life through ink. I see the state of the world and feel the pain that seems to have become a plague of its own. I have a feeling your frustration is at least half caused by the dark cloud each person currently has hanging over their head. I’m sure at least a few… maybe even most of you would like to tear off your apron, throw that furious fastball or delete all fifty pictures and let your camera gather dust in a cluttered closet.I’m truly sorry, but I must ask on behalf of each and every person in this world that you gently put your apron on the stool, let that clay stay balled in your fists and find a spot where your camera won’t be forgotten. Take a walk and let the cooling rain fall in unison with your tears. Collapse on your bed and let your depleted body pass through dreamland’s rainbow gates. Watch a TV show that will have you laughing so hard you might just forget why you’re sitting through a dozen episodes in one sitting.Do what you need to find as much silver in your dark cloud as possible. Once you can see it twinkle, once you can look down at your hands and at the very least think “maybe I should give it one more chance,” please give me new forms. I want to be the sunlit field of green that produces a split-second smile. I’d love to be a poem that gets at least one “heart” reaction on the internet. Maybe I’ll be a watercolor teary-eyed couple escaping from stress and into each other’s arms.When you tie your apron back on, emerge from a heap of past failures with your pencil clutched tightly, feel those words at least piercing your skull or go back to that sunflower field, you give me a chance to do my job: travel across the land and leave behind as many silver linings as possible. As long as you’re still creating, I’m still fighting to reach the hearts of anyone who needs a reminder of why hope is so important.If even one of you has hope, I have what I need to spark some more. Let’s keep this world hopeful together.With love, Art" }, { "title": "Twenty-One Questions", "url": "/posts/Twenty-One-Questions/", "categories": "Story", "tags": "story", "date": "2022-01-26 17:30:00 -0700", "snippet": "“Hey grandpa, why do we have to throw the fish back?”“There are hardly any in this pond, you see. If we took every fish we caught then we couldn’t come here to fish.”“But fish taste so good. Don’t you like fish?”“Of course I do. That’s why I want to be able to come here and watch them swim under the sunrise every morning.”“How come we always have to be here so early?”“You’ve probably never heard this word before, but it’s called ambience. Something about being on the lake when it’s so peaceful, right as a new day is about to begin… well, I think you’ll appreciate it more when you’re older.”“Do you think I’ll live to be as old as you grandpa?”“Hey, who told you how old I was?! If it was your mother then I’m going back on my deal to let her watch her silly ‘reality’ show tonight. Monday Night Football is back on, baby!”“Why don’t you want me to know you’re eighty-three?”“Hmmm… you know, fishing ain’t as easy as it used to be. See how much my hand shakes when I reel in? I sure wouldn’t mind flipping those numbers around.”“Three… eighty… but if you don’t like being old, why would you want to be three-hundred and eighty?”“Hahahahahaha… your dad’s right, you’d make a great comic when you grow up.”“But… how could I turn into a comic book?”“Well you can be plenty of things if you have enough imagination and determination.”“I don’t want to be a comic book though. Do you think I could fight in a war like you did?”“Hah, I’m afraid I’d rather you have a happy life and not have to worry about war.”“But I’ve seen your medals, you’re a hero! And dad told me all about your hurt friend you carried to safety during a battle! Why wouldn’t I want to be a hero too?!”“You can be a hero, but there are lots of heroes out there… especially right now.”“Mom’s worried about aunt Martha, I guess because she’s a doctor. Will she be alright, grandpa?”“I see why your mom is worried, but your aunt is one of the bravest people in the world. Heh, who do you think raised her, a pack of wolves?”“Ohhhh! You’re a hero, so she’s a hero and so is mom because she teaches people stuff they need to know. Could I be an even bigger hero then?!”“Well that’s not up to me to decide. Tell you what though, you can be a pretty big hero right now.”“But aren’t I too young to join the army or go to medical school?”“Didn’t you hear what I said? There are lots of heroes out there, that means you can do lots of things to be a hero. Right now, helping your parents and I laugh is pretty darn heroic.”“I made you laugh earlier! Does that mean I’m already on the way to being a hero?!”“Judging from the way your mom’s eyes light up when she talks about you… I’d say you’re farther along than you think.”“Wow… grandpa, you’re so smart. Do you think I’ll be smart when I’m eighty-three?”“I hope you’re smarter than me, that’s for sure. Forty-one minutes spent on number eighteen the other day… darn crossword puzzles.”“If I wanna be really smart I need to go to school. When will school be open again?”“Sorry, but I don’t think even the smartest person in the world knows the answer to that one.”“But if I stay out of school for too long, won’t I forget everything I’ve learned?”“I think you’ll find the brain is better at remembering stuff then you give it credit for.”“Then how come dad can never remember where he put the keys to his toolbox?”“Now don’t worry about remembering this because you’re going to hear it a lot: nobody’s perfect.”“Not even God?”“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll get to ask him someday.”“But… wouldn’t that mean you’d die?”“Awwww, don’t look so worried. Just like we’ve been talking about, this family’s full of strong people. I’m not going anywhere for a good while.”“Grandpa… when do you think we’ll be able to go anywhere we want again?”“Hah… speaking of God, he might be the only one who knows the answer to that one.”“…Grandpa, please don’t try to ask him, okay?”“Alright, I’ll leave it up to him. Who knows, maybe he’s watching us and might feel generous enough to reward us with- FISH!

Can you imagine one of them reaching to give you a matchAnd asking for their legacy to be what sets your heart ablaze?You may think of someone who, if they were still with you,Would stomp on the used matches and each of their shadowsWhile laughing at the idea of those shadows defining you. That is the kind of person who would watch from the next life And cheer you on as you warm the air around you with each step Closer to the fulfilled, peaceful soul they know you can become, Telling spirits who never even knew you about how lucky they were.Say their name, put your hand on your chest and pretend theirs Is reaching further in to make sure that spark finally gets going.

How many of us will dream of a white ChristmasAnd how many will instead dream of a new yearWhere somehow, someway, the &quot;new normal&quot; is leftIn the screeching, chaotic cacophony that made 2020A type of vision akin to seeing the whole world throughA kaleidoscope that blurs like static on a television?The ghosts of the holiday will surely haunt us,Christmas past mocking our inability to escapeThe distorted face of the present and just assumingSomething better is somewhere in the near future.What do you do when it seems the universe seeksTo take the most wonderful time of year and smother itBeneath a veil big enough to smother us all as well?The first thing you do is take a moment to just breathe,Clear your mind as much as you can before step two:Scratch and claw through the constricting confines of the veil,Scraping away at the wall determined to keep us pinned downUntil even putting up Christmas lights feels meaningless.Scream at the wall, proclaim it has no idea who we are!The spirit of goodness is about more than kind deeds,FAR more than loving smiles and warming hugs. Joy isn&#39;t an emotion you just feel at every turn;In the darkest of hours and bleakest of moments,Joy is something you fight to the bitter end for!With this year seemingly poised to end bitterly,The time has come for us to remember more than everHow much power the exchanging of kindness carries.Flood the social media stream with loving wishesAnd reminders of what we are always thankful for:The people who&#39;ve stayed on the front lines since day one,The silly little things that keep us laughing and of course,Our loved ones who combine to take the patch of veilDirectly above our heads and poke a hole in it.Let anyone you are able to have under your roofKnow just how wonderful it is to spend the day with them. They might just be dangerously close to decidingThis darkness is too much for them to overcome. Now is the time; those holes smaller than our pinkiesMust become big enough for us to squeeze throughSo we can see one another looking up at the lightThis year has fought tooth and nail to hide from us.In the name of the most wonderful time of the year,Let&#39;s turn those cheesy messages and cornier songsInto something more powerful than anything we&#39;ve facedAnd even whatever there still may be to face!
