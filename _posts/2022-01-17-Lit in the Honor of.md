Perhaps you've stroked the match dozens of times,  
Dreamed a different dream every day but still  
Find the flames of passion snuffed out in mere minutes  
No matter what words of encouragement you recite.  
* * *
Hobbies, loved ones and the most ambitious of goals  
Aren't enough to make you stare into the future and see  
The version of yourself you're surely meant to become.  
Used matches litter the ground around you, blackening it  
Like your vision as hope starts to fade from view.   
* * *
If the spark won't come from the present, look behind you:  
There are smiling faces from the past that you know  
Would still be smiling today if only fate had been kinder.   
Can you imagine one of them reaching to give you a match  
And asking for their legacy to be what sets your heart ablaze?  
* * *
You may think of someone who, if they were still with you,  
Would stomp on the used matches and each of their shadows  
While laughing at the idea of those shadows defining you.   
That is the kind of person who would watch from the next life   
And cheer you on as you warm the air around you with each step   
Closer to the fulfilled, peaceful soul they know you can become,   
Telling spirits who never even knew you about how lucky they were.   
* * *
Say their name, put your hand on your chest and pretend theirs   
Is reaching further in to make sure that spark finally gets going.   
They may no longer walk among us, but your flames recapture   
The same spirit they illuminated the lives of everyone they knew with.
