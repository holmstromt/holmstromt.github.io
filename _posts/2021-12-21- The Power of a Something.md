It could be the newest marble in your collection.   
A flavor of candy you've waited years to taste.   
The longest, loudest home run you've ever seen   
Or a child's craft made from popsicle sticks and paste.   
   
   
You might find joy gleaming in a double rainbow   
Following the biggest lightning show in years.   
Maybe you'll take on the same roller coaster   
That was once the master of your fears.    
   
   
It might be a silly, cheesy Christmas special   
You last saw when you were just a child.   
Perhaps you'll dig through your garage and find   
Your old kite to fly again when the weather's mild.    
   
   
The garage may contain old home movies as well,   
Giving you another chance to hear their voice.   
It's been so long since they said their last goodbye...   
Still you're fighting; still they cheer on your choice.   
   
   
You never know, you might find something special   
By simply falling on the grass to watch the sky.    
Sometimes we just need to put the brakes on our lives   
And watch that funny-shaped fluff drift by.    
   
   
So many little somethings are waiting near and far   
So we can remember when feeling burned out:   
The tiniest treasures can bring the greatest joys   
To remind us what this life is all about.
