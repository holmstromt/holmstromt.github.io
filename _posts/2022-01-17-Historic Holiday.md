<p>"It's the most wonderful time of the year"</p>
<p>Or so it's supposed to go when the spooks step away</p>
<p>So the spirit of giving can turn the spotlight red and green.</p>
<p>Now is the time when television reminds us all</p>
<p>That giving beats receiving, we have many thanks to give</p>
<p>And our fellow man is in need of plenty of goodwill...</p>
<p>So we were told as kids by parents and teachers</p>
<p>In between special episodes of our favorite shows</p>
<p>Teaching us all about the importance of coming together</p>
<p>As we escape the cold to find warmth in one another.</p>
* * *
<p>I suppose I should stop beating around the bush</p>
<p>Soon to be sport a layer of snow and twinkling lights.</p>
<p>The festival of fright may be over, but the scares live on</p>
<p>In the form of uncertainty and tension that may bring down</p>
<p>A blizzard of unrest that would end this year so fittingly</p>
<p>Given the storm clouds that seem to rumble every single day.</p>
* * *
<p>Will we have anyone to give thanks over turkey with?</p>
<p>How much peace will we see in our own state,</p>
<p>Let alone on the entire earth for heaven's sake! </p>
<p>How many of us will dream of a white Christmas</p>
<p>And how many will instead dream of a new year</p>
<p>Where somehow, someway, the "new normal" is left</p>
<p>In the screeching, chaotic cacophony that made 2020</p>
<p>A type of vision akin to seeing the whole world through</p>
<p>A kaleidoscope that blurs like static on a television?</p>
* * *
<p>The ghosts of the holiday will surely haunt us,</p>
<p>Christmas past mocking our inability to escape</p>
<p>The distorted face of the present and just assuming</p>
<p>Something better is somewhere in the near future.</p>
<p>What do you do when it seems the universe seeks</p>
<p>To take the most wonderful time of year and smother it</p>
<p>Beneath a veil big enough to smother us all as well?</p>
* * *
<p>The first thing you do is take a moment to just breathe,</p>
<p>Clear your mind as much as you can before step two:</p>
<p>Scratch and claw through the constricting confines of the veil,</p>
<p>Scraping away at the wall determined to keep us pinned down</p>
<p>Until even putting up Christmas lights feels meaningless.</p>
* * *
<p>Scream at the wall, proclaim it has no idea who we are!</p>
<p>The spirit of goodness is about more than kind deeds,</p>
<p>FAR more than loving smiles and warming hugs. </p>
<p>Joy isn't an emotion you just feel at every turn;</p>
<p>In the darkest of hours and bleakest of moments,</p>
<p>Joy is something you fight to the bitter end for!</p>
<p>With this year seemingly poised to end bitterly,</p>
<p>The time has come for us to remember more than ever</p>
<p>How much power the exchanging of kindness carries.</p>
* * *
<p>Flood the social media stream with loving wishes</p>
<p>And reminders of what we are always thankful for:</p>
<p>The people who've stayed on the front lines since day one,</p>
<p>The silly little things that keep us laughing and of course,</p>
<p>Our loved ones who combine to take the patch of veil</p>
<p>Directly above our heads and poke a hole in it.</p>
<p>Let anyone you are able to have under your roof</p>
<p>Know just how wonderful it is to spend the day with them. </p>
<p>They might just be dangerously close to deciding</p>
<p>This darkness is too much for them to overcome. </p>
* * *
<p>Now is the time; those holes smaller than our pinkies</p>
<p>Must become big enough for us to squeeze through</p>
<p>So we can see one another looking up at the light</p>
<p>This year has fought tooth and nail to hide from us.</p>
<p>In the name of the most wonderful time of the year,</p>
<p>Let's turn those cheesy messages and cornier songs</p>
<p>Into something more powerful than anything we've faced</p>
<p>And even whatever there still may be to face! </p>
