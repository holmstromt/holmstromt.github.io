Not knowing when I'll see your smile again... or if...    
Has me wondering when my next smile will come... or if.   
   
   
All the happy memories we made to soften the blow of this day   
Only did enough to pierce my heart rather than shatter it.    

Caffeine shall be my trusty weapon tonight as I fight off   
The call of sleep, knowing my dreams will deceive me.    
   
   
But... being awake gives me time to look up and wonder   
If your sky is as shiny and blue as you deserve.   
   
   
After all the warmth and light you brought into my life...   
How am I supposed to fight off this encroaching chill?    
* * *    
* * *    
* * *   
* * *   
What... did I suddenly drift off or could it have been...   
That is impossible and yet I heard you clear as day.    


I look all around daring to believe fate has found a way   
To surprise even itself but... there is no one else here.    


Still, there is no doubt I heard you say your favorite phrase:   
"As long as the wind is blowing, hope is still out there."    


Has grief claimed victory over my sanity or... could it be?    
Did you deliver me this reminder on your own wings?    


I'd give it all to hear you just once more... but no.    
Your echo reached me for a reason, one I can hear.    


My window is open just enough for your favorite plant   
To gesture with its leaves to a gleam on the outside.    


Into the night I go, barefoot and shivering with no cares   
Except whatever you are guiding me towards... ah.    


The playground where I first swallowed sand for you,   
Still too young and foolish to know how to make friends.   


You light up this spot, the same spot I hid it:    
The symbol of everything you mean to me.    


In the night your star is just enough for me to see   
A symbol that might have come from anybody...   


But I'm enough of a fool to see this star in the sand   
And remember all the times we watched them dance.    


And so... for you, I shall let sleep take me away,   
Knowing that when I awake, the wind will still blow.
