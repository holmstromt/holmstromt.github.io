Dear Artists,
 
Dear you frustrated that you have more paint on your apron than the canvas, you with words in your brain that just can't seem to find a way out of your skull, you who can't find your pencil buried somewhere in the mountains of balled up papers, you fighting the urge to wad up some clay and toss it like a fastball at your incomprehensible sculpture, you wondering why none of the fifty pictures you took of a sunflower field feel worthy of being seen... before you ask the question, allow me to tell you what the point is.   

* * * 
 
Who am I, you ask? I am every canvas that has ever been decorated, each scrap of paper and computer document used to weave literary yarn, any inanimate person given life through ink. I see the state of the world and feel the pain that seems to have become a plague of its own. I have a feeling your frustration is at least half caused by the dark cloud each person currently has hanging over their head. I'm sure at least a few... maybe even most of you would like to tear off your apron, throw that furious fastball or delete all fifty pictures and let your camera gather dust in a cluttered closet.   

* * * 
 
I'm truly sorry, but I must ask on behalf of each and every person in this world that you gently put your apron on the stool, let that clay stay balled in your fists and find a spot where your camera won't be forgotten. Take a walk and let the cooling rain fall in unison with your tears. Collapse on your bed and let your depleted body pass through dreamland's rainbow gates. Watch a TV show that will have you laughing so hard you might just forget why you're sitting through a dozen episodes in one sitting.   

* * * 

Do what you need to find as much silver in your dark cloud as possible. Once you can see it twinkle, once you can look down at your hands and at the very least think "maybe I should give it one more chance," please give me new forms. I want to be the sunlit field of green that produces a split-second smile. I'd love to be a poem that gets at least one "heart" reaction on the internet. Maybe I'll be a watercolor teary-eyed couple escaping from stress and into each other's arms.    

* * * 

When you tie your apron back on, emerge from a heap of past failures with your pencil clutched tightly, feel those words at least piercing your skull or go back to that sunflower field, you give me a chance to do my job: travel across the land and leave behind as many silver linings as possible. As long as you're still creating, I'm still fighting to reach the hearts of anyone who needs a reminder of why hope is so important.   

* * * 

If even one of you has hope, I have what I need to spark some more. Let's keep this world hopeful together.   
 
With love,
