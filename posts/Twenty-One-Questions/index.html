If we took every fish we caught then we couldn’t come here to fish.” “But fish taste so good. Don’t you like fish?” “Of course I do. That’s why I want to be able to come here and watch them swim under the sunrise every morning.” “How come we always have to be here so early?” “You’ve probably never heard this word before, but it’s called ambience. Something about being on the lake when it’s so peaceful, right as a new day is about to begin… well, I think you’ll appreciate it more when you’re older.” “Do you think I’ll live to be as old as you grandpa?” “Hey, who told you how old I was?! If it was your mother then I’m going back on my deal to let her watch her silly ‘reality’ show tonight. Monday Night Football is back on, baby!” “Why don’t you want me to know you’re eighty-three?” “Hmmm… you know, fishing ain’t as easy as it used to be. See how much my hand shakes when I reel in? I sure wouldn’t mind flipping those numbers around.” “Three… eighty… but if you don’t like being old, why would you want to be three-hundred and eighty?” “Hahahahahaha… your dad’s right, you’d make a great comic when you grow up.” “But… how could I turn into a comic book?” “Well you can be plenty of things if you have enough imagination and determination.” “I don’t want to be a comic book though. Do you think I could fight in a war like you did?” “Hah, I’m afraid I’d rather you have a happy life and not have to worry about war.” “But I’ve seen your medals, you’re a hero! And dad told me all about your hurt friend you carried to safety during a battle! Why wouldn’t I want to be a hero too?!” “You can be a hero, but there are lots of heroes out there… especially right now.” “Mom’s worried about aunt Martha, I guess because she’s a doctor. Will she be alright, grandpa?” “I see why your mom is worried, but your aunt is one of the bravest people in the world. Heh, who do you think raised her, a pack of wolves?” “Ohhhh! You’re a hero, so she’s a hero and so is mom because she teaches people stuff they need to know. Could I be an even bigger hero then?!” “Well that’s not up to me to decide. Tell you what though, you can be a pretty big hero right now.” “But aren’t I too young to join the army or go to medical school?” “Didn’t you hear what I said? There are lots of heroes out there, that means you can do lots of things to be a hero. Right now, helping your parents and I laugh is pretty darn heroic.” “I made you laugh earlier! Does that mean I’m already on the way to being a hero?!” “Judging from the way your mom’s eyes light up when she talks about you… I’d say you’re farther along than you think.” “Wow… grandpa, you’re so smart. Do you think I’ll be smart when I’m eighty-three?” “I hope you’re smarter than me, that’s for sure. Forty-one minutes spent on number eighteen the other day… darn crossword puzzles.” “If I wanna be really smart I need to go to school. When will school be open again?” “Sorry, but I don’t think even the smartest person in the world knows the answer to that one.” “But if I stay out of school for too long, won’t I forget everything I’ve learned?” “I think you’ll find the brain is better at remembering stuff then you give it credit for.” “Then how come dad can never remember where he put the keys to his toolbox?” “Now don’t worry about remembering this because you’re going to hear it a lot: nobody’s perfect.” “Not even God?” “I don’t know. Maybe I’ll get to ask him someday.” “But… wouldn’t that mean you’d die?” “Awwww, don’t look so worried. Just like we’ve been talking about, this family’s full of strong people. I’m not going anywhere for a good while.” “Grandpa… when do you think we’ll be able to go anywhere we want again?” “Hah… speaking of God, he might be the only one who knows the answer to that one.” “…Grandpa, please don’t try to ask him, okay?” “Alright, I’ll leave it up to him.
